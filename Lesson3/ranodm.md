## Topic 43: Global Scope and Local Scope in JavaScript

In JavaScript, global scope refers to the context in which variables and functions are accessible throughout the entire code, while local scope refers to the context in which variables and functions are only accessible within the specific block or function in which they were declared.

#### Global Scope
When a variable is declared outside all function or block scopes, it is a global variable and can be accessed from any location in the code.

Example:
```javascript
var globalVar = "I am global!";

function testFunc() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Prints: "I am global!"
}
testFunc();
```

#### Local Scope
Local scope, also known as function scope, confines the visibility of variables to the function within which they are declared.

Example:
```javascript
function testFunc() {
  var localVar = "I am local!";
  console.log(localVar); // Prints: "I am local!"
}
testFunc();
console.log(localVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
```
In the above example, `localVar` is not recognized outside `testFunc` because it's defined in the local scope of `testFunc`.

## Topic 44: Variable Declaration and Assignment within Scopes

In JavaScript, you can declare variables in either the global scope or a local scope. Once a variable is declared, you can assign a value to it.

#### Declaring and Assigning Variables in Global Scope
You can declare a variable in the global scope by initializing it outside of any function or block.

Example:
```javascript
var globalVar;
globalVar = "I am a global variable!";
console.log(globalVar); // Prints: "I am a global variable!"
```

#### Declaring and Assigning Variables in Local Scope
Local variables are declared and initialized within a function or block.

Example:
```javascript
function testFunc() {
  var localVar;
  localVar = "I am a local variable!";
  console.log(localVar); // Prints: "I am a local variable!"
}
testFunc();
```

## Topic 45: Accessing Variables within Different Scopes and Shadowing

You can access variables based on where they are declared. A global variable can be accessed anywhere in your code. A local variable can only be accessed within the function where it's declared.

#### Accessing Variables
A variable declared in a function is not accessible outside that function.

Example:
```javascript
function testFunc() {
  var localVar = "I am local!";
  console.log(localVar); // Prints: "I am local!"
}
testFunc();
console.log(localVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
```

#### Shadowing Variables
When a local variable has the same name as a global variable, the local variable shadows the global one.

Example:
```javascript
var myVar = "I am global!";

function testFunc() {
  var myVar = "I am local!";
  console.log(myVar); // Prints: "I am local!"
}
testFunc();
console.log(myVar); // Prints: "I am global!"
```

In the above example, `myVar` inside `testFunc` shadows `myVar` in the global scope.
