# Variable Hoisting and its implications

## Introduction

In JavaScript, variable hoisting is a concept that can sometimes lead to confusion, especially for beginners. Hoisting refers to how variable declarations and function declarations are processed during the creation phase of the JavaScript execution context. Understanding variable hoisting is crucial to writing predictable and error-free code.

## Understanding Variable Hoisting

Variable hoisting is the behavior where JavaScript moves variable declarations to the top of their respective scope during the compilation phase. However, it's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments.

Let's look at an example to understand this better:

```javascript
console.log(a); // Output: undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // Output: 10
```

In the above code snippet, the variable `a` is hoisted, but its assignment (`var a = 10;`) remains in its original place. This means that when we first log `a`, it is hoisted to the top of the scope and exists but has a value of `undefined`. After that, the assignment is executed, and `a` gets the value `10`.

## Effect of Hoisting on Variable Declaration and Assignment

Variable hoisting can lead to unexpected results if not understood properly. Let's see an example:

```javascript
console.log(b); // Output: undefined
var b = 5;
function example() {
  console.log(b); // Output: undefined
  var b = 15;
  console.log(b); // Output: 15
}
example();
console.log(b); // Output: 5
```

In this code snippet, we have a function `example()` that defines a local variable `b`. Inside the function, the variable `b` is hoisted to the top of the function scope, so the first `console.log(b)` within the function logs `undefined`. Then, after the assignment `var b = 15;`, the second `console.log(b)` logs `15`.

The global variable `b` remains unaffected by the local variable inside the function, as you can see in the last `console.log(b)` statement outside the function, which logs `5`.

## More Examples

Let's explore more examples to solidify our understanding of variable hoisting:

### Example 1:

```javascript
console.log(c); // Output: ReferenceError: c is not defined
c = 25;
console.log(c); // Output: 25
```

In this example, `c` is not declared with `var`, `let`, or `const`. Hence, it is not hoisted, and trying to access it before the assignment leads to a ReferenceError.

### Example 2:

```javascript
console.log(d); // Output: undefined
var d;
console.log(d); // Output: undefined
d = 30;
console.log(d); // Output: 30
```

Here, the variable `d` is declared but not assigned a value before the first `console.log(d)`, resulting in `undefined`. After the assignment `d = 30;`, the last `console.log(d)` logs `30`.

### Example 3:

```javascript
var e = 40;
function example2() {
  console.log(e); // Output: undefined
  var e = 50;
  console.log(e); // Output: 50
}
example2();
console.log(e); // Output: 40
```

This example is similar to the one before, but now we have a global variable `e`. Inside the function, the variable `e` is hoisted and shadows the global `e`, causing the first `console.log(e)` inside the function to log `undefined`. The local variable `e` is then assigned `50`, and the second `console.log(e)` logs `50`. The global `e` remains unchanged.

## Conclusion

Variable hoisting is an essential concept to understand when working with JavaScript. It can impact the behavior of your code, especially when variables are declared inside functions. Remember that only variable declarations are hoisted, not the assignments. By being aware of hoisting, you can write more predictable and maintainable code.

Remember that hoisting applies to `var` declarations, but not to `let` and `const` declarations, as `let` and `const` have block-level scope and do not get hoisted to the top of their scope. Always declare variables before using them to avoid unexpected behavior and make your code more readable.
