# CSS Borders

Borders are a crucial element in web design that can enhance the visual appeal and structure of elements on a webpage. With CSS, you can easily add borders to elements and customize their styles, widths, and colors to achieve the desired design. In this guide, we will explore how to add borders with different styles, widths, and colors using CSS.

## Introduction

In CSS, borders are applied to elements using the `border` property. The `border` property allows you to define the style, width, and color of the border. By manipulating these properties, you can create borders that match your design requirements.

## Adding Border Styles

CSS provides several border styles that you can apply to elements. Here are some commonly used border styles:

- `solid`: Creates a solid line border.
- `dotted`: Creates a border with dotted line segments.
- `dashed`: Creates a border with dashed line segments.
- `double`: Creates a border with two parallel lines.
- `groove`: Creates a 3D grooved border.
- `ridge`: Creates a 3D ridge-like border.
- `inset`: Creates a 3D inset border.
- `outset`: Creates a 3D outset border.
- `none`: Removes the border.

To specify the border style, use the `border-style` property. Here's an example:

```css
.example {
  border-style: solid;
}
```

In this example, the `.example` class has a solid border style. You can replace `solid` with any other border style mentioned above.

Here's a visual representation of each border styles:

## Controlling Border Widths

CSS allows you to adjust the width of borders to create different visual effects. The `border-width` property is used to define the width of the border. You can specify the width in pixels, percentages, or using predefined values such as `thin`, `medium`, and `thick`.

```css
.example {
  border-width: 2px;
}
```

In this example, the `.example` class has a border width of 2 pixels. You can adjust the value to your desired width.

## Setting Border Colors

Customizing the color of borders helps create visual contrast or match the overall design scheme of your webpage. The `border-color` property is used to specify the color of the border. You can use predefined color names, hexadecimal color codes, RGB values, or HSL values to define the color.

```css
.example {
  border-color: red;
}
```

In this example, the `.example` class has a red border color. You can replace `red` with any other valid color value.

## Applying Border to Specific Sides

By default, the `border` property applies the border to all sides of an element. However, you can also apply borders to specific sides individually using the `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and `border-left` properties. This allows you to have different border styles, widths, and colors for each side.

```css
.example {
  border-top: 1px solid red;
  border-right: 2px dashed blue;
  border-bottom: 3px dotted green;
  border-left: 4px double yellow;
}
```

In this example, the `.example` class has different borders for each side, with varying styles, widths, and colors. Feel free to adjust the values to suit your design preferences.

## Diagram: Using Border Properties

HTML file (index.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="example">This is a paragraph with a class 'example'.</div>
    <p id="unique">This is a paragraph with an ID 'unique'.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

CSS file (styles.css):

```css
.example {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2px;
  border-color: red;
}

#unique {
  border-style: dashed;
  border-width: 3px;
  border-color: blue;
}
```

In this example, the CSS applies a solid red border to the paragraph inside the with the class `example`, and a dashed blue border to the paragraph with the id `unique`.
