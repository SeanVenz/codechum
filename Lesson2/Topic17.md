# CSS Selectors: Selecting Elements with Tag, Class, and ID Selectors and Understanding Selector Specificity

CSS selectors play a vital role in targeting and styling specific elements on a web page. Understanding how to select elements using tag, class, and ID selectors is crucial for applying styles to specific parts of your HTML structure. Additionally, comprehending selector specificity helps resolve conflicts when multiple selectors target the same element. In this topic, we will explore selecting elements with tag, class, and ID selectors, as well as understanding selector specificity.

## Introduction

CSS selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. By selecting elements based on their tags, classes, or IDs, you can precisely control the appearance and behavior of your web page. Understanding how selectors work and their specificity is essential for creating well-organized and maintainable CSS styles.

## Selecting Elements with Tag, Class, and ID Selectors

CSS provides different types of selectors to target elements:

### Tag Selectors

Tag selectors target elements based on their HTML tags. For example, to select all `<p>` elements on a page, you can use the following selector:

```css
p {
  /* CSS styles for <p> elements */
}
```

The above selector will apply the defined styles to all `<p>` elements in the HTML document.

### Class Selectors

#### Class

Class selectors target elements with a specific class attribute value. To select elements with a specific class, use a dot (`.`) followed by the class name. For example, to select elements with the class "sample", you can use the following selector:

HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <p class = "sample">This is a paragraph with class.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS file (styles.css):

```css
.sample {
  /* CSS styles for elements with the class "sample" */
}
```

The above selector will apply the defined styles to all elements that have the class attribute set to "sample".

### ID Selectors

ID selectors target elements with a specific ID attribute value. To select elements with a specific ID, use a hash (`#`) followed by the ID name. For example, to select an element with the ID "sample", you can use the following selector:

HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <p id = "sample">This is a paragraph with external styles.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS file (styles.css):

```css
#sample {
  /* CSS styles for elements with the class "sample" */
}
```

The above selector will apply the defined styles to the element that has the ID attribute set to "sample".

## Understanding Selector Specificity

Selector specificity determines which styles will be applied when multiple selectors target the same element. It follows a specific hierarchy:

1. **Inline Styles:** Styles applied directly within the HTML tag using the `style` attribute have the highest specificity.

2. **ID Selectors:** Selectors with ID specificity have a higher priority than class or tag selectors.

3. **Class Selectors:** Selectors with class specificity have a higher priority than tag selectors.

4. **Tag Selectors:** Selectors based solely on HTML tags have the lowest specificity.

In cases where multiple selectors have the same specificity, the order of declaration in the CSS file determines the final styles.

Here's a diagram illustrating the selector specificity hierarchy:

```
Inline Styles > ID Selectors > Class Selectors > Tag Selectors
```

## Additional Considerations

- It's generally recommended to use class selectors for styling elements, as they offer better reusability and flexibility compared to ID selectors.
- Avoid relying too heavily on inline styles, as they can make the code harder to maintain and update.
- Use selector specificity wisely to ensure consistent and expected styles across your web pages.

## Conclusion

CSS selectors are powerful tools that allow you to target specific elements and apply styles accordingly. Understanding the differences between tag, class, and ID selectors helps you apply styles precisely. Additionally, grasping selector specificity ensures that styles are applied correctly when dealing with conflicts.
