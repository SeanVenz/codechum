# HTML Tags and Elements: Understanding HTML tags and their purpose

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) tags play a crucial role in defining the elements and content within a web page. In this topic, we will explore the various HTML tags and their purposes, helping you gain a deeper understanding of how they contribute to creating well-structured web pages.

## Introduction

HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) and provide instructions to web browsers on how to display and interpret the content within them. Each HTML tag serves a specific purpose, representing different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. By understanding these tags and their functions, you can effectively structure your web pages and convey meaningful information to your users.

## Understanding HTML Tags and Their Purpose

Let's explore some commonly used HTML tags and their purposes:

### Headings

Headings are used to represent the hierarchical structure of a web page's content. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (highest level) to `<h6>` (lowest level). The main heading of a page is typically denoted by `<h1>`, while subsequent headings represent sub-sections.

### `<p>`: Paragraphs

The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs of text within an HTML document. It is commonly used to structure and format blocks of text.

### `<br>`: Line Breaks

The `<br>` tag is used to insert line breaks within an HTML document. It is an empty tag, meaning it does not need a closing tag, and it does not accept any attributes. The `<br>` tag is useful when you need to create a new line but don't want to start a new paragraph with the `<p>` tag.

### `<img>`: Images

The `<img>` tag is used to embed images within an HTML document. It requires the `src` attribute to specify the image file's URL and the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.

### `<a>`: Links

The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other web pages or resources. The `href` attribute is used to specify the destination URL of the link.

### `<ol>` and `li` : Ordered Lists

The `<ol>` and `<li>` tags are used to create ordered lists, commonly displayed as numbered or lettered lists. They are useful when presenting items that have a specific order or sequence.

### `<ul>` and `<li>`: Unordered Lists

The `<ul>` tag is used to create an unordered list, commonly displayed as bullet points. Each list item is defined by the `<li>` tag.

### `<nav>`: Navigation

The `<nav>` tag is used in HTML to define sections of navigation links, typically found in headers, footers, or sidebars of a web page. It aids in accessibility and site navigation.

## Diagram: Common HTML Tags

Here is a diagram summarizing some common HTML tags and their purposes:

```
<h1> to <h6>    : Headings
<p>             : Paragraphs
<img>           : Images
<a>             : Links
<ol> and <li>   : Ordered Lists
<ul> and <li>   : Unordered Lists
<br>            : Line Breaks
<nav>           : Navigation
```

## Conclusion

Understanding HTML tags and their purposes is fundamental to creating well-structured and meaningful web pages. Each HTML tag serves a specific function and plays a vital role in conveying information and organizing content.
