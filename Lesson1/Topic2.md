# HTML Tags and Elements: Understanding HTML tags and their purpose

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of the web, providing the structure and organization for web pages. HTML tags play a crucial role in defining the elements and content within a web page. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the various HTML tags and their purposes, helping you gain a deeper understanding of how they contribute to creating well-structured web pages.

## Introduction

HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) and provide instructions to web browsers on how to display and interpret the content within them. Each HTML tag serves a specific purpose, representing different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. By understanding these tags and their functions, you can effectively structure your web pages and convey meaningful information to your users.

## Understanding HTML Tags and Their Purpose

Let's explore some commonly used HTML tags and their purposes:

### Headings

Headings are used to represent the hierarchical structure of a web page's content. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (highest level) to `<h6>` (lowest level). The main heading of a page is typically denoted by `<h1>`, while subsequent headings represent sub-sections.

### `<p>`: Paragraphs

The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs of text within an HTML document. It is commonly used to structure and format blocks of text.

### `<img>`: Images

The `<img>` tag is used to embed images within an HTML document. It requires the `src` attribute to specify the image file's URL and the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.

### `<a>`: Links

The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other web pages or resources. The `href` attribute is used to specify the destination URL of the link.

### `<ol>` and `li` : Ordered Lists

The `<ol>` and `<li>` tags are used to create ordered lists, commonly displayed as numbered or lettered lists. They are useful when presenting items that have a specific order or sequence.

### `<ul>` and `<li>`: Unordered Lists

The `<ul>` tag is used to create an unordered list, commonly displayed as bullet points. Each list item is defined by the `<li>` tag.

### `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`: Tables

HTML provides tags for creating tables. The `<table>` tag defines the table, `<tr>` represents a table row, `<th>` is used for table headers, and `<td>` is used for table cells.
