# HTML Horizontal Line: Inserting a Horizontal Line with the `<hr>` Tag

## Introduction

The `<hr>` tag in HTML is used to insert a horizontal line, also known as a "horizontal rule," on a webpage. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag. Horizontal lines can be used to visually separate sections of content, or create a visual break.

## Inserting a Horizontal Line

To insert a horizontal line using the `<hr>` tag, simply include the tag in your HTML code. Here's an example:

```html
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is more text.</p>
```

In this example, a horizontal line is inserted between two paragraphs of text. When rendered in a browser, the line will extend across the width of its containing element.

## Diagram: Horizontal Line

Here is a diagram illustrating the placement and appearance of the horizontal line:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Horizontal Line Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This is more text.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

## Conclusion

The `<hr>` tag is a simple yet effective way to insert a horizontal line on a webpage. It can be used to visually separate content sections, or create a break in the layout.
